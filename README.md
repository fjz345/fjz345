Hi, I’m @fjz345.

I’m interested in game development, playing games. Currently my favorites games are Dota 2, Osu, Battlerite, Factorio, Dead by Daylight, Age of Empires II DE and Rocket League.

I gratuated as an civil engineer in game and software programming at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) 2021 and currently I am working at Box Dragon as a Rendering Programmer.
